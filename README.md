## IBEM | Introduction

My learning source for HTML and CSS was a YouTube channel “Free Code
Camp” with instructor Mike Dane. I consulted the website
“w3schools.com” for further help and exercises. My illustration teacher was
“GFX Mentor”. At first, I decided the design and theme for my portfolio. Then
I created my logo and web pages. I did 100% work on my own.
This personal portfolio has three web pages that display Personal Data,
Personal Statement, and Project Pages. I coded the HTML and CSS codes
for the navigation bar of all pages. I used hyperlinks to link these pages with
each other. I used different tags of HTML-5 for the development of my
portfolio like; Html, head, title, meta, body, div, nav, link, img, ul, li, heading
tags, footer, etc.
